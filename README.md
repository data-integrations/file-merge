Build
-----
To build this plugin:

```
   mvn clean package
```    

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/hdfs-file-merge-<version>.jar config-file <target/hdfs-file-merge-<version>.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'hdfs-file-merge-<version>':

    > load artifact target/hdfs-file-merge-<version>.jar config-file target/hdfs-file-merge-<version>.json
